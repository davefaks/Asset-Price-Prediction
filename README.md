# LSTM Recurrent Neural Network for Asset Price Prediction

This project involves building a Long Short Term Model (LSTM) recurrent neural network to predict the price direction of an asset based on historical data, utilizing a prediction window of 30 minutes. The objective of this project is to leverage available data and develop a robust predictive model.

By thoroughly documenting each step and providing clear explanations of the decisions made throughout the modeling process, this notebook aims to demonstrate a strong understanding of deep learning principles and their application to financial price prediction. The insights gained from this project can inform future work in asset price forecasting and contribute to more effective decision-making in financial markets.
